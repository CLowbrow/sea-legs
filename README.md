#Css lexing for the rest of us

Look here sonny, back in my day we didn't have no fancy regular expressions or tools that generated lexers/parsers from grammar definitions. 

What we **DID** have was a can-do attitude, a spring in our step, and first order functions. And we made due, dammit.

## Ok, but what is this?

This is a (bad) css lexer with some helpers bolted on to the front of it that I will probably use for something useful once I make it good enough.
